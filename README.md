# blindside_challenge

A Flutter UI, contains login UI, linked with an API from an app hosted on Heroku.
Once you successfully login, you'll find a UI that contains list of videos, suggestions and comments.

To get started, clone the project and type in the terminal ##flutter pub get
Later, type ##flutter run

Cheers.
